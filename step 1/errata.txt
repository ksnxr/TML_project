There are several small issues with the slides used for the recording, which are listed below.

On slide 4, the reference group is chosen by hand, instead of being automatically selected.

On slides 6 and 7, terminology of the reference group is refined.

On slide 7, "comparison to 0 false negative rate" is deleted. 

These are fixed in the uploaded slides. Please refer to that version instead.
